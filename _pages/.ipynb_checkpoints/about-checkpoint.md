I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, fortunately advised by [Professor Kenichi Oishi](http://www.open-map.org/#member) and [Professor Craig Jones](https://imagingai.org/). Previously, I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Professor René Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html). 

My research lies at the intersection of deep learning and medical imaging, with a focus on brain MRI analysis. Specifically, I work on transformer-based models for brain age estimation and diffusion-based approaches for neonatal lesion inpainting. More broadly, my interests span multimodal representation learning, clinically informed model design, and improving the generalizability of medical imaging models.

My long-term research vision is to advance methods for multimodal information representation through the Vision-Language models and foundation models, and to leverage deep learning to bridge AI and clinical practice, with the goal of deepening our knowledge of brain cognition, neurodevelopment, and neurodegeneration.

Previously, I received my BS in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Economics, with a minor in Physics, from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I was advised by [Professor Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/).
