I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, supervised by [Professor Ren√© Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html). 

My research interests focus on deep learning and computer vision. I care about enhancing the generality, reliability, and robustness of high-dimensional feature representation in deep learning. Additionally, I am working on effectively leveraging multi-modal inputs to enhance the understanding capabilities of neural networks. This includes combining textual and image information for applications in object detection tasks. My current research is related to object detection and adversarial robustness.

Previously, I received my BS in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Economics, with a minor in Physics, from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I was advised by [Professor Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/).
