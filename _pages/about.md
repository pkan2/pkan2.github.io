I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, supervised by [Professor Ren√© Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html). 

My main research interests focus on deep learning and computer vision. I care about building practical deep learning models and machine learning algorithms for computer vision and understanding the representation of deep learning with improving its generalizability, reliability, and robustness. My current research is related to object detection and adversarial robustness.

Previously, I received my BS in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Economics, with a minor in Physics, from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I was advised by [Professor Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/).
